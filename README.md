# TGIF

This is a very simple website where I consume a third party API from the US Congress with the senators data 
and then it is displayed with the most voted, less voted and the bottom 10% and the top 10% of most voted senators.

Demo web app where is displayed Congressional data from the ProPublica Congress API https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/

There were several steps to accomplish:

- Getting an API key for the ProPublica Congress API
- Getting the JSON objects for the two chambers of Congress and saving them in files
- reating HTML pages that use JavaScript to display the JSON data in tabular form, and CSS to format the tables nicely
